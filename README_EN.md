## Deployment

> To use activity reporting, pair this project with [Waken-Wa-Reporter](https://github.com/MoYoez/waken-wa-reporter).

### 1. Local Deployment

#### Docker With the Packaged One-Line Script

Make sure **Docker** is installed, including `docker compose`. Then run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://waken-wa.xwx.today | bash
```

> The script automatically resolves the latest **stable version tag** and starts the matching `moyoez/waken-wa:<tag>` Docker Hub image. By default, it does not track `main`, which makes it a better fit for everyday self-hosted deployments. SQLite data is stored in a Docker volume by default; see `docker-compose.yml` for details. Environment variables can be configured from [`.env.example`](.env.example), or by editing `.env` in the deployment directory.

To deploy the latest `main` branch version explicitly, enable:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://waken-wa.xwx.today | USE_LATEST_VERSION=1 bash
```

You can also override the branch, repository, image, or install workspace with environment variables:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://waken-wa.xwx.today | WAKEN_BRANCH=main bash
curl -fsSL https://waken-wa.xwx.today | WAKEN_IMAGE=moyoez/waken-wa:v0.30 bash
curl -fsSL https://waken-wa.xwx.today | WAKEN_WORKSPACE=~/waken-wa-deploy bash
```

#### Build From Source

Run the following from the root of a cloned repository. **Git** and **Docker** are required.

```bash
chmod +x deploy-build-from-source.sh   # Required on Unix for the first run
./deploy-build-from-source.sh
# Or: bash deploy-build-from-source.sh
```

> The script prepares `.env` by copying from `.env.example` when needed, generates `JWT_SECRET` when appropriate, and runs `docker compose up -d --build`. You can also set environment variables such as `WAKEN_BRANCH`, `WAKEN_REPO_URL`, and `WAKEN_DEPLOY_DIR`; see the script comments for details.

#### Deploy on Windows

##### 1. Prepare the Environment

Make sure the following tools are installed:

- **Docker Desktop** is recommended. Podman Desktop or another Docker Compose compatible container tool can also work.
- **Git** is optional, but strongly recommended for syncing and managing source code.
- If Git is not installed, you can use GitHub's “Code” -> “Download ZIP” option and extract the project locally.

##### 2. Get the Source Code

Using Git is recommended:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/MoYoez/waken-wa.git
cd waken-wa
```

Alternatively, download the ZIP archive and enter the extracted project directory.

##### 3. Configure Environment Variables

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then adjust it as needed. In most basic deployments, no extra configuration is required unless you want customization.

##### 4. Start the Container

If you only want to run the official image without building from source, open PowerShell or CMD in the project root and run:

```powershell
docker compose up -d
```

##### 5. Build From Source

If you changed the source code or want to build a custom image, run:

```powershell
docker compose up -d --build
```

##### 6. Notes

- The first startup may automatically prepare the database and related data volumes.
- To stop the service, run `docker compose down`.
- To upgrade, pull the latest source code with Git and restart the service.
- If you run into port conflicts or environment variable issues, check the repository docs or open an issue.

### 2. Railway

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/waken-wa)

> Railway may require a Hobby plan.

### 3. Vercel

> Vercel deployment requires PostgreSQL (Supabase / Neon) and Redis. It may be relatively costly because of SSE long connections and frequent realtime POST requests.

> If you deploy on Vercel, consider using non-realtime activity uploads and enabling Polling in the admin panel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](
https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/MoYoez/waken-wa
)

> If the first deployment fails, do not panic. In the project's "Integrations" page, open "Marketplace", install and connect a **PostgreSQL** provider and a **Redis** provider, then redeploy.

> If you prefer your own provider, set its URL in the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. Pay attention to URL compatibility on serverless platforms such as Vercel to avoid deployment failures.
